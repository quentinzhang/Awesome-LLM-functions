# Awesome OpenAI Functions

<p align="center"><small><b>English | <a href="README-zh.md">中文</a></b></small></p>

## Objective

The function calling mechanism of OpenAI is very powerful, but the development and debugging of functions are quite cumbersome. The internet also lacks tools and resources in this area.

This project aims to create a "plug and play" shared function set and provide some resources and technical frameworks related to function development. This allows developers to easily integrate external functions with the large language model's API to achieve the desired functions.

## Function List

Click on the following functions for details. Copy the function definition to easily test function calls through [ConsoleX.ai](https://console.evalsone.com/).

* [Weather Inquiry (get_current_weather)](info/get_current_weather.md)
* [Exchange Rate Inquiry (get_exchange_rate)](info/get_exchange_rate.md)
* [Get Latest Hacker News Content (get_top_hacker_news)](info/get_top_hacker_news.md)
* Generate MidJourney prompts
* Quickly obtain video content summaries
* Inquire product prices


> **Note**
> Some of the above functions are generated through the [OpenAI Plugin Convertor](https://consolex.ai/plugins).
