# Awesome OpenAI Functions

<!-- <p align="center"><small><b>English | <a href="README-zh.md">中文</a></b></small></p> -->

## Objective

The function calling mechanism of OpenAI is very powerful, but the development and debugging of functions are quite cumbersome. Tools and resources for function implementing are also very rare on Internet.

This project aims to create a "plug and play" shared function set and provide some resources and technical frameworks related to function development, allowing developers to easily integrate external functions with the large language model's API to achieve the desired functions.
